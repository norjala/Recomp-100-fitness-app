# Overview

ðŸ’¯ Day Recomp is a 100-day body recomposition competition web application built with React, TypeScript, and Express. The app tracks contestants' body composition changes through DEXA scan uploads, implements gender-specific scoring algorithms, and provides competitive leaderboards. Users can register for the competition using simple email/password authentication, upload and track multiple DEXA scans, view their progress over time, and compete with others in a fair scoring system.

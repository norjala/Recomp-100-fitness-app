**Recovery Status**: ‚ùå Data cannot be recovered from backups  

## Investigation Findings

### What Happened
1. **Data Loss Event**: Jackie's user account and DEXA scan data were completely wiped from the database
2. **Root Cause**: The `reset-user-scans.sql` script was executed, which contains:
   - `DELETE FROM dexa_scans;` - Deleted ALL user scan data
   - `DELETE FROM scoring_data;` - Deleted ALL scoring data
3. **Timeline**: Occurred sometime around September 8, 2025
4. **Backup Status**: Database backup from September 5 was already empty, indicating the reset happened before backup

### Why Recovery Failed
- **No Available Backups**: Both main database and backup were affected by the reset
- **No Audit Trail**: Audit logging was not implemented at the time of the incident
- **Script Execution**: The reset script was designed to wipe ALL user data for testing purposes

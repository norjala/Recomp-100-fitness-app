# üö® CRITICAL: Fix Required in Render Dashboard

## The Problem
Your scan saving is failing because of a **session/database mismatch**. The user "Jaron" exists in your browser session but NOT in the production database.

## Why This Happened
1. The persistent disk configuration was wrong (mounted at `/opt/render/project` instead of `/opt/render/persistent`)
2. Every deployment wiped the database
3. Your browser still has the old session cookie
4. The user in the session doesn't exist in the new database

## IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### Step 1: Update Render Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

**Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Environment tab**

Update or add these environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=/opt/render/persistent/data/fitness_challenge.db
UPLOADS_DIR=/opt/render/persistent/uploads
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: These MUST match the paths in render.yaml!

### Step 2: Clear Your Browser Data

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear Storage ‚Üí Clear site data
4. OR use Incognito/Private mode

### Step 3: Create a New Account

After the deployment completes:
1. Go to your site
2. Register a NEW account (can be "Jaron" again)
3. This account will now persist across deployments

## What the Fix Does

The enhanced error handling will now:
1. **Check if user exists in database** before trying to save scan
2. **Return clear error messages** instead of generic 500 errors
3. **Log detailed information** to help debug issues

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When you try to save a scan:
- If user doesn't exist in database: "User session is invalid. Please log out and log in again."
- If validation fails: Specific validation errors
- If database constraint fails: "A scan with this date already exists"
- Success: Scan saves properly

## Verification Steps

1. After deployment, check logs for:
   - "‚úÖ Using persistent storage - data will survive deployments"
   - "‚úÖ Found existing database (X.XX MB) - preserving user data"

2. Test the fix:
   - Clear browser data
   - Create new account
   - Add a scan
   - Push any small change to trigger redeployment
   - Verify account and scan still exist

## If Still Failing

Check Render logs for these specific error messages:
- "USER_NOT_IN_DATABASE" - Clear browser and create new account
- "USER_VERIFICATION_FAILED" - Database connection issue
- "VALIDATION_FAILED" - Check the scan data being sent
- "DUPLICATE_SCAN" - Scan for that date already exists

## Long-term Solution

The persistent disk is now correctly configured at `/opt/render/persistent`. Future deployments will preserve:
- User accounts
- DEXA scans  
- Uploaded files
- All database data

This is a one-time fix. Once properly configured, your data will persist forever.

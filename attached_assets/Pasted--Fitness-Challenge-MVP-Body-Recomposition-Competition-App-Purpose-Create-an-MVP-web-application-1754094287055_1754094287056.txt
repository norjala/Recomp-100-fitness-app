üèÜ Fitness Challenge MVP ‚Äì Body Recomposition Competition App
Purpose:
Create an MVP web application for a 100-day body recomposition competition. Contestants compete to lose body fat and gain muscle, measured by DEXA scans. The app should make tracking, scoring, and competition transparent, fun, and fair.

1. User Registration & Baseline Input
Allow new contestants to create a profile with:

Name

Gender (male/female)

Weight

Height

Baseline input fields:

Date of initial DEXA scan

Body fat %

Lean mass (lbs or kg)

Upload a photo (image/PDF) of their DEXA scan report

2. DEXA Scan Upload & Parsing
Users can upload DEXA scan images or PDFs.

The app parses and extracts:

Body fat %

Lean mass

Weight

Scan date

(If parsing fails, user can manually enter stats.)

3. Multiple Scan Support & Progress Tracking
Users can upload multiple DEXA scans (e.g., start, mid, final).

App shows side-by-side comparison of baseline and latest scan for each user:

% change in body fat

% change in lean mass

Timeline/progress chart

4. Automatic Scoring
Calculate each contestant‚Äôs score using this logic:

Fat Loss Score (FLS):
FLS_raw = ln(BF%_start / BF%_end) √ó 100 √ó Leanness Multiplier

Leanness Multiplier varies by gender and starting BF% (see below).

Muscle Gain Score (MGS):
MGS_raw = (Lean_Mass_%_Change) √ó 100 √ó 17 √ó Gender_Multiplier

Gender Multiplier: Men = 1.0, Women = 2.0

Normalize both FLS and MGS across all contestants (min-max normalization to 1-100 points).

Total Score = FLS + MGS (max 200 points).

Display formulas and multipliers in app for transparency.

5. Leaderboard
Display a live leaderboard:

Rank by aggregate score (Total Score = FLS + MGS)

Show contestant names, current stats, and progress (body fat %, lean mass, score breakdown)

Allow users to see each other‚Äôs progress & scan history

6. Core UX/UI Requirements
Clean, simple, and mobile-friendly interface.

Profile page for each contestant with scan history and progress charts.

Leaderboard page visible to all.

Secure login and data storage.

7. Scoring Logic Details
(for developers ‚Äî can include as backend logic or utility functions)

Leanness Multiplier (Men):

25% BF: 1.0x

21-25%: 1.1x

18-20.9%: 1.2x

15-17.9%: 1.3x

<15%: 1.4x

Leanness Multiplier (Women):

30% BF: 1.0x

26-30%: 1.1x

23-25.9%: 1.2x

20-22.9%: 1.3x

<20%: 1.4x

Muscle Gain Gender Multiplier:

Men = 1.0

Women = 2.0
